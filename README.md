### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Oluwatobi Oluyede, a web developer and tech enthusiast.

Iâ€™m currently working on a resume builder SaaS using the MERN stack.
I'm also leading my team in the DevCareer x TBD Web5 hackathon.

I'm currently learning frontend development with ReactJS and also how to build simple APIs with Node and Express.js.
